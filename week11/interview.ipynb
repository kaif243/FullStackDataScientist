    "# 1. What is Python and why is it popular in Data Science?\n",
    "### Python is a high-level programming language that is popular in data science because of its simplicity and powerful libraries like NumPy and Pandas.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Difference between List, Tuple, Set, and Dictionary\n",
    "\n",
    "### List is ordered and mutable, Tuple is ordered and immutable, Set is unordered with unique values, and Dictionary stores data in key-value pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. What is a Lambda function?\n",
    "\n",
    "### A lambda function is an anonymous one-line function used for short operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. What is map(), filter(), reduce()?\n",
    "\n",
    "### map() applies a function to all elements, filter() selects elements based on a condition, and reduce() reduces elements to a single value.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 5. Difference between NumPy array and Python list?\n",
    "\n",
    "### NumPy arrays are faster and support vectorized operations, while Python lists are slower and more flexible.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 6. What is Pandas used for?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pandas is used for data manipulation, cleaning, and analysis using DataFrames.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 7. How do you handle missing values?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Missing values can be handled by removing them or replacing them with mean, median, or mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 8. Difference between loc and iloc\n",
    "\n",
    "### loc accesses data using labels, while iloc accesses data using index positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 9. What is Mean, Median, Mode?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mean is the average, Median is the middle value, and Mode is the most frequent value.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 10. What is Variance and Standard Deviation?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variance measures data spread, and standard deviation is the square root of variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 11. What is Correlation?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Correlation measures the relationship between two variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 12. What is Machine Learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Machine learning is a technique that allows systems to learn from data without being explicitly programmed.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 13. Types of Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "### Supervised, Unsupervised, and Reinforcement learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 14. Difference between Regression and Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "### Regression predicts continuous values, while classification predicts categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 15. What is Linear Regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Linear regression models the relationship between input and output using a straight line.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 16. What are assumptions of Linear Regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Linearity, independence, homoscedasticity, and normality.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 17. What is R² score?\n",
    "\n",
    "### R² score measures how well the model explains the variance in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 18. What is Logistic Regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Logistic regression is a classification algorithm used to predict binary outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 19. Why sigmoid function is used?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sigmoid function converts values into probabilities between 0 and 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 20. Difference between Linear and Logistic Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "### Linear regression predicts continuous values, while logistic regression predicts probabilities or classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 21. What is Margin in SVM?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Margin is the distance between the decision boundary and nearest data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 22. What are Support Vectors?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Support vectors are the data points closest to the decision boundary.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 23. What is Kernel Trick?\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Kernel trick transforms data into higher dimensions to make it linearly separable.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 24. Types of Kernels\n",
    "\n",
    "### Linear, Polynomial, RBF, and Sigmoid kernels.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 25. What is C parameter in SVM?\n",
    "\n",
    "### C controls the trade-off between margin size and classification error.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 26. What is Train-Test Split?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Train-test split divides data into training and testing sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 27. Difference between Batch and Streaming\n",
    "\n",
    "### Batch processes large data at once, while streaming processes data in real time.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 28. What is ETL?\n",
    "\n",
    "### ETL stands for Extract, Transform, and Load of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 29. Difference between Bias and Variance\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bias is error due to oversimplification, and variance is error due to overfitting."
